/**
   \class TruncMean
   The truncated mean class allows to compute the following quantities
   1) the truncated mean profile of an ordered vector of values, such as 
   the charge profile along a particle's track.
   To create such a profile use the function CalcTruncMeanProfile()
   2) Get the truncated mean value of a distribution. This function
   iteratively hones in on the truncated mean of a distribution by
   updating the mean and cutting the tails after each iteration.
   For this functionality use CalcIterativeTruncMean()
   doxygen documentation!

        Input vectors are assumed to be match pair-wise (nth entry in rr_v
        corresponds to nth entry in dq_v vector).
        Input rr_v values are also assumed to be ordered: monotonically increasing
        or decreasing.
        For every dq value a truncated linear dq value is calculated as follows:
        0) all dq values within a rr range set by the class variable _rad are selected.
        1) the median and rms of these values is calculated.
        2) the subset of local dq values within the range [median-rms, median+rms] is selected.
        3) the resulting local truncated dq is the average of this truncated subset.
