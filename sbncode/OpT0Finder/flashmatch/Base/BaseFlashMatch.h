       CORE FUNCTION: takes in flashmatch::QCluster_t (TPC object) and flashmatch::Flash_t (flash) \n
       and inspect if two are consistent (i.t. matched) or not. Returns flashmatch::FlashMatch_t \n
       which represents the compatibility of two inputs. In particular the algorithm needs to  \n
       set the "score" and "QPoint_t" of the return object. The former represents the goodness \n
       of a match with a value larger than 0. Negative value is interpreted as no match.       \n
       The latter represents the matched TPC 3D point. The "tpc_id and "flash_id" of the return \n
       object is set by flashmatch::FlashMatchManager, the caller of the algorithm, as it manages \n
       the overall collection of user input flash and TPC objects. \n
       \n
       Note it is flashmatch::FlashMatchManager configuration option to allow an assignment of the \n
       same flash to multiple TPC object or not. If not allowed, a match with a higher "score"  \n
       in the return object is chosen.
