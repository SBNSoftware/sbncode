SBN Code
========
This package contains code for SBN-wide simulation and analysis. This includes:

* `fcl`: Production FHiCL configurations
* `sbncode`: Common LArSoft modules and other utilities
* `sbnanalysis`: A unified SBN analysis framework, for event selections and
  fits

Note that the `sbnanalysis` subpackage is built separately; see the included
README for more information.
